/**
 * Fedify: a fediverse server framework
 * ====================================
 *
 * Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps
 * powered by [ActivityPub] and other standards, which is so-called [fediverse].
 * It aims to eliminate the complexity and redundant boilerplate code when
 * building a federated server app, so that you can focus on your business
 * logic and user experience.
 *
 * Currently, Fedify provides the following features out of the box:
 *
 * - Type-safe objects for [Activity Vocabulary] (including some vendor-specific
 *   extensions)
 * - [WebFinger] client and server
 * - [HTTP Signatures]
 * - [Object Integrity Proofs][FEP-8b32] & [Linked Data Signatures]
 * - Middlewares for handling webhooks
 * - [NodeInfo] protocol
 * - Special touch for interoperability with Mastodon and few other popular
 *   fediverse software
 * - Integration with various web frameworks
 * - CLI toolchain for testing and debugging
 *
