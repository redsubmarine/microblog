Feature pull requests should target the *main* branch.


Build
-----

### Directories

The repository consists of the following directories:

 -  *cli/*: The Fedify CLI.  The CLI is built with [Deno].
 -  *docs/*: The Fedify docs.  The docs are built with [Node.js] and
    [VitePress].
 -  *examples/*: The example projects.  Some examples are built with Deno, and
    some are built with Node.js.
 -  *src/*: The Fedify library.  The library is built with Deno, and tested with
    Deno, Node.js, and [Bun].
     -  *codegen/*: The code generation scripts.

[Deno]: https://deno.com/
[VitePress]: https://vitepress.dev/
[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[Bun]: https://bun.sh/

### Development environment

Fedify uses [Deno] as the main development environment.  Therefore, you need to
install Deno to hack on Fedify.

> [!TIP]
> If you use [mise-en-place], a dev tools/env vars manager and a task runner,
> you can easily install Deno, [Node.js], and [Bun] with following commands:
>
> ~~~~ bash
> mise trust
> mise install
> ~~~~

The recommended editor for Fedify is [Visual Studio Code] with
the [Deno extension] installed.  Or you can use any editor that supports Deno;
see the [*Set Up Your Environment* section][1] in the Deno manual.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Fedify heavily depends on code generation, so you need to run
> `deno task codegen` before coding or testing.

Assuming you have Deno and Visual Studio Code installed, you can open
the repository in Visual Studio Code and get ready to hack on Fedify by running
the following commands at the *root* of the repository:

~~~~ bash
deno task codegen
code .
~~~~

Note that the `deno task codegen` command is required to run only once at
very first time, or when you update the code generation scripts.   Otherwise,
you can skip the command and just run:

~~~~ bash
code .
~~~~

Immediately after running the `code .` command, Visual Studio Code will open
the repository, and you can start hacking on Fedify.  If you encounter the
following message:

> Do you want to install recommended 'Deno' extension from denoland for
> this repository?

Please click the *Install* button to install the Deno extension.

[mise-en-place]: https://mise.jdx.dev/
[Visual Studio Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[Deno extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno
[1]: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment/

### Running the Fedify CLI

If you want to test your changes in the Fedify CLI, you can run
`deno task -f @fedify/cli run` command.  For example, if you want to test
the `fedify lookup` subcommand, you can run the following command:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/cli run lookup @fedify@hollo.social
~~~~

> [!TIP]
>
> Unlike the Fedify library, the Fedify CLI does not have to be tested with
> Node.js and Bun; you can test the CLI with Deno only.

#### Running the tests

If you want to test your changes in the Fedify library, you can run
the following command:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/fedify test
~~~~

If the tests pass, you should run `deno task test-all` command to test
the library with Deno, Node.js, and [Bun]:

~~~~ bash
deno task test-all
~~~~

Of course, Node.js and Bun should be installed on your system to run the tests
with Node.js and Bun.

> [!TIP]
> If you use [mise-en-place], a dev tools/env vars manager and a task runner,
> you can easily install Deno, [Node.js], and [Bun] with a single command:
>
> ~~~~ bash
> mise install
> ~~~~

### Building the docs

If you want to change the Fedify docs, you would like to preview the changes
in the browser.  To do that, you need to install [Bun] first.
Then you can run the following commands at the *docs/* directory:

~~~~ bash
bun install
bun dev
~~~~

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate
to *http://localhost:5173/* to view the docs.
